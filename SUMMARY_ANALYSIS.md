## Conclusions

Across the three year period, SD (NYSE:SD) had the greatest single-year growth percentage, gaining 11,675% in 2016.

Conversely, KMI.W (NYSE:W) had the greatest single-year percentage loss, plummeting 98.59% in 2015. BAC (NYSE:BAC) remained consistently popular, recording the greatest single-year share trading volume for each year. 

Consequently, it’s fair to say you would earn quite a bit on your return if you invested in SD, and would be pretty hard down by if you invested in KMI.W. 

** Note - highly-exaggerated return values on SD and KMI.W indicate extremely high volatility ratings and necessary risk appetites which may need to be considered if investing in either tickers. 

** Note - BACs high total volume across each year period does not correlate to substantial value growth or decline.
